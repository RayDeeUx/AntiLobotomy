# AntiLobotomy

Disables difficulty faces, SFX, and Song triggers from loading in levels related to lobotomies.

Since this is done based on level name, there is no one-size-fits-all-solution.
There will not be a setting to apply this mod to all levels regardless of its name.

<cy>*(Two YouTubers have already tried using this mod on Logodomy by TheMilkCat before checking the mod settings. Please don't be the third to make that mistake.)*</c>
