# AntiLobotomy

Mod logo by [Brift](https://twitter.com/BriftXD)!

Disables difficulty faces, SFX, and Song triggers from loading in levels related to lobotomies.

Since this is done based on level name, there is no one-size-fits-all-solution.
There will not be a setting to apply this mod to all levels regardless of its name.
